Welcome to my API Hack Capstone for my Web Developer Bootcamp, Bloc!

Name: Dr. Muse's Fantastical Writing Prompt Generator

GitHub Pages Link: https://amrvitale.github.io/WritingPromptAPIHackCapstone/

Summary
This application uses 3 APIs to produce a writing prompt for an aspiring fiction author.
First, the writer selects a genre. From the genre, an image is randomly selected for "plot inspiration" from the Pixabay API.
Then, the writer selects a theme, from which the second API, QuoteGarden, generates a quote.
Lastly, the RandomUser API generates a name of the protagonist and a location for the story.
The final screen displays all prompt pieces together, along with a button to restart the prompt generator.

Technology Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
